AI Chat - learning project
This is a beginner-friendly AI chat project in Python.  It contains two versions: a real AI chat using OpenAI, and a mock GUI chat for testing.
Versions

1. Console Chat – chat.py
* Chat with a real AI using OpenAI API.
* Chat history is saved in chat_history.txt.
* Requires an OpenAI API key stored in your environment variable OPENAI_API_KEY.
2. GUI Chat – mock_chat.py A simple GUI chat window using Python's Tkinter. Does not require an API key – responses are fake, just for testing. Features a chatbox, input field, and send button.
